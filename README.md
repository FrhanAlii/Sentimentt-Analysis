Sentiment Analysis on PDF Dataset
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a dataset extracted from a PDF file. The analysis was performed using two machine learning models: Naive Bayes (achieving 66% accuracy) and Random Forest (achieving 80% accuracy). The project leverages the NLTK library for text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction.

Key features:

Preprocessing of text data from a PDF file.
Comparative analysis of Naive Bayes and Random Forest models.
Insights into sentiment classification with varying accuracies.
This repository is a practical demonstration of text classification techniques, ideal for exploring sentiment analysis using Python and NLTK.
